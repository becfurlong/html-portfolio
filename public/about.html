<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Rebecca Furlong. I am married and have two kids, well not really kids at 19 and 16. We live in Melbourne, Australia and I enjoy playing softball, playing board games and going to the beach.</p>

<p>I studied Accounting at university and have worked in public practice as well as having my own bookkeeping business. After spending two years living with my family in the USA I joined a SAAS business as the implementation manager and enjoyed seeing how my skill and strengths could be used in a totally different industry.<br />
After being made redundant from that role, I gained a role at Visory as the Implemtation Manager which made for a beautiful convergence of my bookkeeping and software implementation experience.<br />
I have recently started studing software engineering and am really enjoying the challenge </p>

<p>I love people and I love solving problems, if I combine them and solve problems with or for people I come alive. I am a logical, strategic and analytical thinker. I work well autonomously but thrive in a team. I am hard working, planned, organized, can multitask and have a high attention to detail. I am able to follow instructions and I take initiative when appropriate. I enjoy a challenge and love learning. I am fun, kind and thoughtful.</p>
